### 문제 설명

<p>After a few months of playing on his new phone, Mirko has finally decided to find a new hobby. He discovered a card game called bridge!</p>

<p>It is known that bridge is played by four players using a 52-card deck, 4 suits total (clubs, hearts, diamonds and spades) and 13 values (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2). At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 13 cards.</p>

<p>Before starting the game, each player counts their so-called honor points in the following way:</p>

<ul>
	<li> each ace (A) is worth 4 points</li>
	<li>each king (K) is worth 3 points</li>
	<li>each queen (Q) is worth 2 points</li>
	<li>each jack (J) is worth 1 point</li>
	<li>the remaining cards (that will be denoted with X in this task) are worth 0 points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the fact that Mirko has started playing bridge only recently, he has decided to practice couting points. He dealt himself cards N times and each time counted his honor points. In the end, he added them up.</p>

<p>He wants to know if he’s done a good job. Help Mirko and check! </p>
